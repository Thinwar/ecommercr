Based on the code structure and styling in your ecommerce site,  the key design choices made during development:

Layout and Structure
Semantic HTML: Used proper semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <section>, and <footer> for better accessibility and SEO
Grid-based Products Layout: Implemented CSS Grid with 3 columns for desktop, collapsing to single column on mobile for responsive design

Responsive Design
Mobile-First Approach: Media queries at 768px and 600px breakpoints
Flexible Images: Product images scale to fit containers with proper aspect ratios
Adaptive Layout: Navigation and form elements adjust for smaller screens
